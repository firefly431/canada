Canada Compiler
===============

Canada is a C-like language I made for fun to practice writing a compiler.

A sample program can be found in the file [program.samp](program.samp).

Status
------

Lexer: *done*  
Parser: *done*  
Code Generator: **NOT DONE**

Dependencies
------------

* Python 3
* PLY (Python Lex/Yacc)
* NASM (for assembly)

TODO
----

* Make the `*` operator not require parentheses
* Array literals
